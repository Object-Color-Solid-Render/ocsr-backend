Hello, welcome to the demo for OCStudio.

this is Tianyun. Zack, Jonathan, Daisy, and I over the course of the fall of 2024,
collaborated on developing OCStudio.

Essentially, OCStudio is an integrated application that real-time renders color solids and ostwalds slices, which give
intuitive 3D visualization of color perceptions.

To generate an color solid The user supplies the application with up to four spectral peaks, and a pigment template function.

The generation completes in a matter of miliseconds, and the user may pan, zoom in and out, and rotate the generated color solid.

The user may also intuitively obtain an ostwald slice by visually "slicing" the generated solid.
